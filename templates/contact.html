    <h1>About the Developers</h1>
    <p><strong>DevMate</strong> is an intelligent multi-agent code analysis platform developed by 
      <strong>Oushnik Banerjee</strong>, a passionate software engineer from 
      <strong>Chandigarh University</strong> pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

    <h2>👨‍💻 Creator's Background</h2>
    <p>Oushnik is a <strong>LeetCode Knight</strong> and <strong>Codeforces Pupil (1350+ rating)</strong> 
      with strong foundations in algorithms, data structures, and software design. Ranked 
      <strong>1st in AMCAT</strong> among 5000+ students in his university, he consistently demonstrates 
      problem-solving excellence and technical mastery.</p>

    <p>He has hands-on experience with <strong>Java, Python, AWS, MySQL, React.js, and SpringBoot</strong>. 
      During his contribution to <strong>GirlScript Summer of Code</strong>, he built open-source features 
      in collaboration with distributed teams, mastering structured Git workflows and clean coding principles.</p>

    <h2>🚀 Motivation Behind DevMate</h2>
    <p>While working on cloud-based and AI-driven systems, Oushnik noticed that many code review tools lacked 
      intelligent reasoning — they were static, unable to understand design intent or learning patterns. 
      DevMate was born from this challenge: a <strong>multi-agent system</strong> that combines static analysis, 
      AI-driven review, and detailed PDF reporting to help developers write secure, maintainable, and efficient code.</p>

    <p>DevMate integrates <strong>Groq-powered LLMs</strong> with <strong>security scanning, complexity metrics, 
      and AI review agents</strong> to produce human-readable, actionable reports. Every report is automatically 
      generated with an overall <strong>code health score</strong> to guide continuous improvement.</p>

    <h2>🏗️ Other Notable Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MediTrack:</strong> A React-based doctor-patient portal with real-time dashboards.</li>
      <li><strong>Algo Smart Tracker:</strong> A Java tool for managing DSA problem-solving progress using MySQL.</li>
      <li><strong>PatentLit:</strong> A data-driven patent analytics system that automated reporting workflows using Pandas and FPDF.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎓 Research and Publications</h2>
    <p>Oushnik’s research on <strong>Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) Susceptibility Assessment</strong> 
      was published with <strong>Wiley Publications (2024)</strong>:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}, 
      highlighting his multidisciplinary approach to data analysis and AI-assisted environmental risk modeling.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Vision</h2>
    <p>The mission behind DevMate is to make intelligent development accessible — merging 
      <strong>AI-driven insights, real-time code analysis, and automation</strong> to empower developers and teams worldwide.</p>

    <p>“<em>Code should not just run — it should evolve intelligently.</em>” — <strong>Oushnik Banerjee</strong></p>
